# GameMath

I think i'm switching this to C++...

This is awesome: https://github.com/victorfisac/Physac/blob/master/src/physac.h

I should figure our how do have the physics look in another thread... 
also also I think that GameMath will just be GameMath and then I will figure our whta the physics engine will be.
